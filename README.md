# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple CLI-based number guessing game where the computer selects a random number, and the user has to guess it within a limited number of chances. The user can select a difficulty level, and the game will provide hints (greater/less) if the guess is incorrect. The game supports multiple rounds, keeps track of high scores, and displays the time taken for each round.

## Features

- Three difficulty levels: Easy (10 chances), Medium (5 chances), and Hard (3 chances)
- Feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low
- Tracks the fewest attempts (high score) in the current session
- Multiple rounds with the option to play again
- Timer to measure how long it takes to guess the number
